### Backstory

BrickHack 6 at Rochester Institute of Technology was my first hackathon. I was going in there to win. I wanted to maximize my chances of winning so I know I needed to find a group of people that aligned with the same goal. So I took one of my friends to the team matching session before the hackathon started. I found two more teammates who wanted to go for the Wegmans sponsored prize (A grocery store chain on the North East). I suggested the idea of a meal prep service like HelloFresh, but instead of getting it delivered, you could pick it up at your neartest Wegmans for some cost savings.

I suggested the meal prep service, and it took some back and forth of thinking about other ideas before we decided on the meal prep service. I would act as a mentor to the less experienced team members, brushing them up on the technology we were using, while also allocating the other team members to their strengths. We built the frontend and backend using AngularJS and Express in Typescript respectively. The database used was MongoDB.

We won the title for "Most impactful to RIT student lives" and honorable mention for "Most Commercially Viable Product"
